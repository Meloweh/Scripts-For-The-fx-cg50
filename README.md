# Scripts-For-The-fx-cg50

These scripts are written for the fx-cg50 calculator model in vanilla Python.

The main attraction is atableV2.py, which, using the input of a state transition table
calculates the following things:
- Truth tables
- DNF
- CNF
- KV diagrams
- Flipflop transitions (flipflops selectable)

Other small scripts provide help on electro-technical conversions in signal processing.
